;;; Commentary:

;; This file is an addition to pure-emacs.
;; This file contains packages that I would expect to be part of Emacs
;; in the future.
;; The same principles apply to this configuration:
;; - Fast start-up time.
;; - Configuration runs out of the box.
;; - No key-bindings modified.

;;; Code:


;;; Provide
(provide 'pure-future)
